            <p>A multinational is a company which is incorporated in a single country but its operations are spread across borders. One of the things distinguishing a multinational from just an investment organization which invests in companies abroad is the aspect of control in the former. While the above is just a basic definition, there are some specific definitions that different organizations use, with Black's Law Dictionary suggesting that a company is a multinational if at least 25% of its revenue is from outside its home country.</p>
